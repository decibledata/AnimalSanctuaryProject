# AnimalSanctuaryProject

## DESCRIPTION
This project we are instructed to model an animal sanctuary, where animals live happy lives, and are cared for by an attendant. 

This projects approach compared to my last focuses with starting with primarily the functions first and the design last. I've noticed that a variety of functions are used in order to achieve a variety of results during the run phase of the program.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED
Given our previous week we have made a shift from basic functionallity to Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP uses objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks you assign. Primarily with methods and classes. This only scratches the surface of the complexity, as we use a few of the 4 pillars in Java.
	* Java
 	* Eclipse
 	* Sublime
 	* Git/GitHub
 	* Zsh/Unix
 	* MacOS Terminal
 	* Inheritance 
 	* Encapsulation
 	* Polymorphism

## CONCEPTS

With gaining a brief understanding of APIE, Ive found myself referring to many discussions and recorded zoom meetings to reiterate the basic concepts of the used functions.

During this project in its early stages i found myself testing various loops. '.this' statements, encapsulation, method calling, inhereitence 
(Which allows me to pull data from another class and implement it into my current window.) and something else im still trying to wrap my head around, but will surely grasp it soon enough.
